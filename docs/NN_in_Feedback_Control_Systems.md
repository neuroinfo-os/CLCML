#### INTRODUCTION
The article provides an overview of various multiloop controllers and controllers using NN, which allow learning model-free controllers for a class of nonlinear systems.
There are two main Neural Network Control Topologies: direct and inderect. __Indirect__ control aims to learn dynamics of the unknown plant (dynamical system) via *identifier block* first; then it uses aquired information to control the plant via *controller block*. __Direct control__ directly tunes the parameters of an adjustable NN controller.

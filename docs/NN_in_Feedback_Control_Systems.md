### Introduction
The aricle provides an historical overview of development of NN usage in feedback control systems and multiloop controllers algorithms using NN.


In adaptive control there are two main Neural Network Control Topologies: direct and inderect. __Indirect__ control aims to learn dynamics of the unknown plant (dynamical system) via *identifier block* first; then it uses aquired information to control the plant via *controller block*. __Direct control__ directly tunes the parameters of an adjustable NN controller.

The challenge in using NN for __feedback control__ is to select a adequate control system structure, and then to tune the NN weights to guarantee closed-loop stability and performance.


The use of neural networks (NN) in feedback control systems was first proposed by Werbos [1989]. Early works aimed to adress several challenges for closed-loop controll systems. The main are: "weight initialization for feedback stability, determining the gradients needed for backpropagation tuning, determining what to backpropagate, obviating the need for preliminary off-line tuning, modifying backprop so that it tunes the weights forward through time". Overviews of the early works regarding NN control could be found in the Handbook of Intelligent Control [White 1992].

### Controllers' algorithms

#### Feedback Linearization Design of NN Tracking Controllers
The section dedicated to  NN feedback controllers that  makes a robotic system to follow a certain trajectory or path in conditions where nor the dynamics of the robot, nor disturbances are known.

##### Multi-Layer Neural Network Controller
It's assumed that desired controller function and appropriate weights are unknown. 
The NN design approach allows for nonlinearity in the parameters, and in effect the NN learns its own basis set on-line to approximate the unknown function f(x). The structure consists of two loops: _the feedback linearization loop_ which incorparates the NN which learns  the unknown dynamics on-line to cancel the nonlinearities of the system. The outer _PD tracking loop_ controlls behavior with specally predifined robustifying function.  Tthe stability of the algorithm is proven using nonlinear stability theory (an extension of Lyapunovâ€™s theorem).

##### Single-layer Neural Network Controller
If the first layer weights V are fixed so that one has the simplified tuning algorithm for the output-layer weights update. 

##### Feedback Linearization of Nonlinear Systems Using NN
 Feedback Linearization NN controller input has two parts: a _feedback_ linearization part and plus an extra _robustifying_ part. Then two separate NNs are trained. For the first one the weight update is exactly the same as in the Multi-Layer Neural Network Controller. To train the second NN the formula should be modified in a way that makes it's output bounded away from zero. Otherwise the whole control would be infinite. 

##### Partitioned Neural Networks and Input Preprocessing
This approach implies partitioning of the controller in terms of partitioned NN or neural subnets. This simplifies the design, gives added controller structure, and allows faster weight tuning algorithms. An advantage of this structured NN is that if some terms in the robot dynamics are well-known (e.g. inertia matrix M(q) and gravity G(q)), then their NNs can be replaced by equations that explicitly compute these terms.

#### NN Control for Discrete-Time Systems
To implement a controller algorythm on a computer it is necessary to specify it in a digital(discrete-time) form. In 1999 Lewis, Jagannathan, and Yesildirek showed that it is possible to guarantee system stability and robustness with an N-layer NN controller. Sich a controller should be composed of two parts: the gradient algorithm and robystifying descrete-time term(a.k.a. "forgetting term"). 

#### Multi-loop Neural Network Feedback Control Structures

The class of controllers with _include additional inner feedback loops_ is required for systems with _additional dynamical complications_ or _additional performance requirements_. using Lyapunov energy-based techniques, it was shown that if each loop is bounded (state-strict passive<sup>1</sup>), then the overall multiloop NN controller provides stability, performance, and bounded NN weights (Lewis, Jagannathan, and Yesildirek,  1999).
There are sevral examples of Multi-loop NN controllers provided in the article : Backstepping Neurocontroller for __Electrically Driven Robot__; __Compensation of Flexible Modes and High-Frequency Dynamics__ and __a Force Control algorithm__.

<sup>1</sup> _a  _passive system_ is a system, which cannot store more energy, than energy supplied to the system. A _strictly passive system_ bounded further by some parameter,lower than amout of input energy.

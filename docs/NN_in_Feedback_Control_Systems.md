### INTRODUCTION
The article is dedicated to possibilities NN bring for providingmodel-free learning controllers for a class of nonlinear systems.
The variety of multiloop controllers and controllers using NN are discussed.

There are two main Neural Network Control Topologies: direct and inderect.

Authors present an Iterative Learning Control (ILC) algorithm for trajectory tracking in a nonlinear system on a swinging up a pendulum on a cart task.
It was shown, that described ILC algorithm can learned to swing up a pendulum by angle trajectory tracking in six iterations. 
The novelity in the controller design is that it learns on trajectory segments with small tracking errors.

The aim of the work is to explore how the first and second statistical moments of stochastic dynamical networks can be controlled by interfering only with a subset of nodes. The described approach, known as _pinning control_ (or _clamping control_), consists of the following steps:
1. Description of firs and second statistical moments of a system;
2.
   * Identification of moments' subsets which can steer the whole system in a desired state;
   * Identification of original nodes corresponding to described moments' subsets;
3. Feedback controller design.

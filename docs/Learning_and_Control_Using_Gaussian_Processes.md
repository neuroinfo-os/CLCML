### Summary 
The article shows how Gaussian Processes (GP) can be used for learning control-oriented models. To overcome basic challenges, that arise when system controled via machine learning  __Fully black-box models__ are used. Opposed to  __Mix of black-box and physics-based models__, that use NN to model the dynamics only of a sub-system or to model only dynamics uncertanties, this approach implies modelling of the full dynamics of a system.
